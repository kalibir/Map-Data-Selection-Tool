# MAP DATA SELECTION TOOL

This tool allows the user to select areas on a map and then create and download a JSON file with the geo data regarding that same selection.
The user can also upload a JSON file and provided it has the right data format (GEOJSON) it will display all the selections contained on the file on the map.

This tool was built using React.js MaterialUI and Mapbox.
